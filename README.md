# pokemon-game-50
This is my submission for my "Pokemon" homework assignment from Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Game Development course.

## Notes

### Bug: can't run away from battle
Sometimes, when the player tries to run away from a battle, the game will crash. This bug was already present in the game's original source code from the course's repo, and I couldn't fix it.

### Use of GitHub Copilot
I'm paying for GitHub Copilot's Individual Subscription, which generated some of my code. I will add all the instructions that I gave to Copilot that generated my code in the "References" section of this README file.

### Code generated by GitHub Copilot
I saved all the code generated by the Copilot Chat that I used in my project in a file called "copilot-chat-and-prompts.txt". All the Copilot code that I used that's being cited on my references can be found in that .txt file.
