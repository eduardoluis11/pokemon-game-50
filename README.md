# pokemon-game-50
This is my submission for my "Pokemon" homework assignment from Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Game Development course.


## Use of GitHub Copilot
I'm paying for GitHub Copilot's Individual Subscription, which generated some of my code. I will add all the instructions that I gave to Copilot that generated my code in the "References" section of this README file.

## Code generated by GitHub Copilot
I saved all the code generated by the Copilot Chat that I used in my project in a file called "copilot-chat-and-prompts.txt". All the Copilot code that I used that's being cited on my references can be found in that .txt file.
