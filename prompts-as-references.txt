1) /explain Explain what this snippet does. I'm making a game in Lua and Love2D which is a clone of Pokemon. This snippet handles the leveling up of the Pokemon (the player) when they earn enough experience points. Well, tell me in more detail how this snippet works.

2) The snippet that I'm selecting is like the front-end of a menu that shows up when you level up in this Pokemon-like game. Well, below the self.playerPokemon:levelUp() snippet, create a new menu that prints a message that says "Hello World". To do that, it seems that you'll have to insert the message into the State Stack. To do that, it seems that you'll have to use a snippet like the following: "gStateStack:push(MessageState('Hello World'))". I don't know if that specific snippet will work, but I think it needs to be in around that format.

3) /fix With my current iteration of the code, the message "Hello World" is printed after the screen that says that you've earned experience points. HOWEVER, the game gets hard-locked after I hit enter after the screem that says "Hello World" shows up. Please, make the game be playable once again after you hit Enter on "Hello World". That is, the player should exit the "Battle Scene", and go back to the overworld.

6) /explain Please explain what the init() function of the FadeOutState() function does. Also, I think I get it: "onFadeComplete" is just a parameter created specifically for the init() function of the FadeOutState() function in FadeOutState.lua? That is, it's jsut a variable that only exists as a parameter for the init() function of the FadeOutState() function?

9) Edit the line of code that says " gStateStack:push(BattleMessageState("HP: " .. self.playerPokemon.HP .. ' + ' .. globalHPIncrease .. ' = ' .. (self.playerPokemon.HP + globalHPIncrease) .. " Attack: " .. globalAttackIncrease .. " Defense: " .. globalDefenseIncrease .. " Speed: " .. globalSpeedIncrease, ". Modify it so that it takes the initial stats (such as "self.playerPokemon.HP") BEFORE the levelUp() function is called. The reason for this is that, after the levelUp() function is called, the initial stat (like self.playerPokemon.HP) will have increased, and I want that stat BEFORE the increase. Then, after you store in a variable the initial value of that starting stat, insert it into the line of code that shows the stat increases in "self.playerPokemon.name_of_stat". That way, all the stats will be correctly added and calculated, and will print properly on the game. As it is, the starting stat is adding the stat increase twice, since the stat increase is already added to the initial stat after the levelUp() function is called. So, fix this.

10) Modify the selected snippet snippet so that it diesplays all that text on a menu. To create a menu, you need to create an instance of the Menu{} class. Here's the init() function of the Menu{} class: "function Menu:init(def) self.panel = Panel(def.x, def.y, def.width, def.height)
self.selection = Selection {
    items = def.items,
    x = def.x,
    y = def.y,
    width = def.width,
    height = def.height
}
end". So, using these pieces of data, create a menu within the gStateStack:push() function.

11) The cod that you gave me didn't work. Just when I was about to display the menu, the game didn't render the menu, and the game got hard-locked in the battle screen. Please, take this code that I'm highlighting as a reference, since the "--remove the last attack state from the stack" snippet of 2 lines shows a menu that is similar to the menu that I want to display.
